##  Developer Reports

###  (Developer-1 Max Nguyen)

-   Activity/accomplishments since last scrum
    -   implemented method to allow admin (election-official/auditor) to create a new account
    -   added ability for election-official to create a new question, answer and election
    -   added ability for election-official to update a question
    -   added ability for election-official to update an answer
    -   added ability for election-official to update the name of an election
    -   added ability for election-official to "remove a question"; the question does not actually
    get removed from the database, but rather set as inactive for that election and sets all
    corresponding answers to be inactive
    -   added ability for election-official to "remove an answer"; the answer does not actually
    get removed from the database, but rather set as inactive for that election
    -   added ability for election-official to "remove an election"; the election does not actually
    get removed from the database, but rather gets set as inactive
    -   added ability for election-official to set an elections' status to either active or inactive,
    as well as set the start and end date for the election
    -   implemented the ability for an auditor (election-official has same capabilities) to get the
    final result of an election, meaning the winner or majority answer to each question. If the majority
    of votes goes to "Abstain Vote", then the second majority wins
    -   implemented the ability for an auditor (election-official has same capabilities) to see all
    casted ballots with the questions and selected answers, but does not include the voters name
    -   implemented the ability for an auditor (election-official has same capabilities) to see the
    number of votes for each answer of each question, including the number of "Abstain Vote"
    -   implemented a method "abstainVote" that will force the user to select "Abstain Vote" if
    they don't want to choose any of the answer options; having them selection "Abstain Vote"
    makes it easier for us to calculate the number of "Abstain Votes" for the auditors report
-   Planned activity before next scrum
    -   Starting to look at and map out how we will do our presentation and powerpoint slides
    -   Help the others with their work, when they need
-   Obstacles/Issues
    -   None
